## Quickstart Guide - Wolfram System Modeler (WSM)

### What is WSM?
Wolfram System Modeler is developed by Wolfram MathCore, is a simulation software for engineering modeling and simulation based on the Modelica language. Find more information about WSM: [here](https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/)

You will need either a trial version or a license for WSM. To get a trial, follow the link [here](https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/trial/)

WSM runs on Windows, Mac OSX or Linux.

It is recommended you get familiar with WSM by following the tutorials in the links below:

### Quisktart

While using these models would require some familiarity with Modelica and WSM, the packages have been setup so that users without such experience can run some of the default simulations.

In the instructions below, we illustrate how to load the OpenIPSL library and the `Example1` & `Example2` packages:
