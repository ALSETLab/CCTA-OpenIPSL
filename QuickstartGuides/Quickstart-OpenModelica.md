## Quickstart Guide - OpenModelica
While using these models would require some familiarity with Modelica and OpenModelica, the packages have been setup so that users without such experience can run some of the default simulations and linearization examples. 

In the instructions below, we illustrate how to load the OpenIPSL library and the `Example1` & `Example2` packages:
  1. Adding OpenIPSL in OpenModelica using OM's package manager - TBD.
  2. Download the files of this repository by cloning with GIT. Alternatively, you can click [here](https://github.com/ALSETLab/CCTA-OpenIPSL/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.1.zip) to download the *.zip file.
  3. If you have cloned both OpenIPSL's and this repository, navigate to the location where it is stored them. If you have downloaded the *.zip file, uncompress it in a directory to which you have read/write rights, e.g. `C:\Users\myUserName\Documents\Dymola`. You should now have two directories, one called `OpenIPSL-3.0.1` and the other `CCTA-OpenIPSL-1.0.x`, as shown below. Note that `x` denotes the version of the release of this repository.
