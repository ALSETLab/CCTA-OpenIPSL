<p>The models within this Modelica package were developed for the paper:</p>

<p>[1] L. Vanfretti and C.R. Laughman, &ldquo;Power System Modeling for Identification and Control Applications using Modelica and OpenIPSL,&rdquo; 2024 IEEE Conference on Control Technology and Applications (CCTA), Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom, 2024, pp. 525-532, doi: 10.1109/CCTA60707.2024.10666594. Publisher's website: <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10666594\">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10666594</a></p> 

<p><br>The models are an updated and improved version of those presented in the paper:</p>
<p>[2] L. Vanfretti and X. Bombois, &quot;Power System Oscillation Monitoring and Damping Control Re-Design under Ambient Conditions and Multiple Operating Points,&quot; manuscript submitted to 20th IFAC Symposium on System Identification. Nov. 10, 2023, pre-print of submitted article available at: <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.22504.28166\">http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.22504.28166</a></p>
<p>The models in this package have been substantially modified and documented so that they can be reused by third parties. There may exist some differences in the original and the current version due to enhancements and modification that were required to make them more user-friendly.</p>
<p>Finally, observed that the models used in [2] were updated to apply control redesign techniques presented in the following publication [3]. Note that the models and scenarios presented in [2] are more complex model than that used in [3].</p>
