<p>The models within this Modelica package were developed for the paper:</p>
<p>[1] L. Vanfretti and C.R. Laughman, &ldquo;Power System Modeling for Identification and Control Applications using Modelica and OpenIPSL,&rdquo; Invited Paper, submitted to the 2024 8th IEEE Conference on Control Technology and Applications (CCTA), Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, August 21-23, 2024, pre-print available at: <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.17471.11680\">http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.17471.11680</a></p>
<p>The models are an updated and improved version of those presented in the following paper:</p>
<p>[2] Xavier Bombois, Luigi Vanfretti, &ldquo;Performance monitoring and redesign of power system stabilizers based on system identification techniques,&rdquo; Sustainable Energy, Grids and Networks, Volume 38, 2024, 101278, ISSN 2352-4677, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.segan.2024.101278\">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.segan.2024.101278</a> . Author&rsquo;s Copy: <a href=\"https://hal.science/hal-04338856\">https://hal.science/hal-04338856</a></p>
<p>The models were originally developed using similar component models and parameters as the single-machine infinite bus model used in the Example 13.2 in [3], pp. 864-869, implemented using the OpenIPSL library.</p>
